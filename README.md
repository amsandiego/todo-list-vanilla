## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) - Charting library for React
- CSS Modules for styling React components
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### Continued development

Be familiar with other Recharts APIs. Experiment with other forms of styling like Styled Components in React.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54330155/recharts-turn-off-background-hover-for-bar-charts) - This helped me in one of the 'bugs' I was trying to fix, which was to remove the gray background area when hovering on bar charts.
- [Recharts BarChart API](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/BarChart) - Great documentation on using the BarChart API of Recharts. Details parent and child components and customizable properties.
